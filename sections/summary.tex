\section{Summary}
I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from National Taiwan University in 2021. During my studies, I took a Computer Security course where I gained hands-on experience with binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and web exploitation through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. These exercises introduced me to tools like GDB, IDA Pro, and x64dbg. I began my career as a software engineer at Trend Micro, focusing on networking. Over time, I gradually learned knowledge about TCP/IP, network analysis by tcpdump, and gained extensive experience in network development and C/C++ programming and debugged in various Linux environments from busybox-based system to mainstream Linux distributions like Ubuntu.
I enjoy solving complex problems and am always committed to investigating and identifying root causes with persistence and attention to detail.
