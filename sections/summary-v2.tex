\section{Summary}
I'm currently working at Trend Micro as a software engineer. Although there are some other role as I'm playing, (Don't say it but mean it: I still couldn't let go of a good opportunity to work as a network security engineer in your company. Therefore, here I only focus on the expertise with regard to network security).
I am an experienced Network Security Engineer with a strong track record of successfully integrating security solutions into ISP router devices. I excel in troubleshooting recurring technical challenges related to iptables, Linux system functionalities, Linux conntrack, and cross-compilation. Proficient in tools such as GDB, iptables, and network analysis tools like tcpdump and Wireshark, I have a collaborative approach to problem-solving and a commitment to enhancing project quality and system efficiency. I am currently seeking new opportunities in the field of network security where I can leverage my expertise and contribute to a secure and efficient network environment.
