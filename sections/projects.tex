	\item Performance profiling using mpstat, Perf and Flamegraph
	\item Improved I/O performance via bcache and RDMA remote ramdisk
  \item Conducted simple read/write fio micro-benchmark and a real world genomic analysis tool (bigsnpr) workload 
	\item Achieved ~3.5x speedup on read test and 2x speedup on real-world genomic analysis test against traditional method 
\end{itemize}

  \item Add kernel pagetable per process to allow user va mapping in kernel mode  
  \item Implement lazy allocation functionality that the kernel only allocates and maps a new physical page when a page fault happens in lazily allocated address
  \item Enable copy-on-write fork that the child uses the same mapping as the parent, and then copy and write to a new page when a store page fault occurs in a copy-on-write page
  \item Manipulate inode structure to enable larger file size
  \item Add symbolic link support so that the kernel refers file target by pathname instead of inode
  \item Implement mmap that enables memory-mapping to a file
  \item Manipulate network interface card hardware control registers to transmit/receive packets 
  \item Written in C, debugged on gdb
\end{itemize}
